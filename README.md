# Hypixel Chat Logger
Have you ever been in the sweatiest bedwars game, and your teammate gives you vital comms, but you miss his message?
  I made this for that exact reason, simply logs the messages that have been /msged|/pc and displays those in a separate window.

# Prerequisites
The location for "latest.log' differs by instance, I have built executables for the most used of those locations. If you use a client that 
stores the location elsewhere, feel free to rebuild the executable with the code and change the log location there.

This was designed in mind for people with more than one display, however nothing stops you from alt-tabbing to view msgs.
